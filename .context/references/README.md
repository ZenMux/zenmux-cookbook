# Documentation

- This location is primarily used for reference by Cursor and Windsurf, but to avoid disrupting their indexing context and damaging the code project structure, it needs to be added to `.gitignore`.
- We provide an automated script `scripts/update-references.sh` to manage reference projects.

## Usage

1. Add GitHub repository links to clone in the `.references/references-list.txt` file, one per line. For example:

   ```txt
   https://github.com/vercel/ai.git
   https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot.git
   ```

2. Run the automated script:

   ```shell
   ./scripts/update-references.sh
   ```

3. The script will automatically perform the following operations:
   - Clone or update repositories under the `.references` directory for each link
   - Automatically add repository paths to the `.gitignore` file
   - Ensure each entry occupies a separate line in `.gitignore`

## Manual Management (Not Recommended)

If you need to manually manage reference projects, follow these steps:

```shell
# Clone project to .references directory
git clone https://github.com/vercel/ai.git .references/ai

# Then ensure the corresponding entry is added to .gitignore
echo ".references/ai" >> .gitignore
```
